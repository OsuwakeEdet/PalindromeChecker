# Palindrome Checker ðŸ”„  

A lightweight JavaScript utility to detect palindromes (words or phrases that read the same backward and forward). This tool handles edge cases like capitalization, spaces, and punctuation, making it robust and reliable.

### Features  
- **Case Insensitive**: Treats "RaceCar" and "racecar" as identical.  
- **Special Character Filtering**: Ignores spaces, punctuation (e.g., `!`, `?`, `,`), and symbols.  
- **Efficient Algorithm**: Uses string reversal and regex cleaning for optimal performance.  
- **Vanilla JS**: Zero dependencies, making it lightweight and easy to integrate.  

### How It Works  
1. Converts the input string to lowercase for case insensitivity.  
2. Removes all non-alphanumeric characters using a regular expression.  
3. Compares the cleaned string to its reversed version to determine if itâ€™s a palindrome.  

### Why This Project?  
- Great for learning fundamental JavaScript concepts like string manipulation, and algorithmic thinking.  
- Demonstrates a common interview question implementation.  
- Perfect for developers looking to practice clean and efficient coding.  

### Installation  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Import the function into your project.  
3. Call the function with your desired input string to check for palindromes.
